# Stopwatch-Application
This script implements a basic stopwatch application. Users can interact with the stopwatch through a simple text-based menu with options to start, stop, reset, and quit the application. The stopwatch records timestamped events and their durations to a CSV file (stopwatch_log.csv), providing a log of activities.

## Features:
- Start: Initiates the stopwatch.
- Stop: Halts the stopwatch and displays the elapsed time.
- Reset: Resets the stopwatch to zero.
- Quit: Exits the stopwatch application.

## Usage:
- Run the script.
- Follow the on-screen menu to control the stopwatch.
- The application logs events, including timestamps and durations, to stopwatch_log.csv.
